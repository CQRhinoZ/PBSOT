# Parallel Branches-based Second-Order Transformer for Robust Group Re-identification with Layout-Guided Occlusion Mitigation

This is a pytorch implementation of 《Parallel Branches-based Second-Order Transformer for Robust Group Re-identification with Layout-Guided Occlusion Mitigation》(ESWA 2025, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2025.128679)). 


## Abstract

Group Re-identification (GReID) seeks to accurately associate group images with the same members across different cameras. However, existing methods mainly focus on the challenges of layout and membership variations while neglecting the occlusion problem caused by layout variations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Parallel Branches-based Second-Order Transformer (PB-SOT) framework, which consists of a Parallel Learning Branch (PLB) module and a Layout-guided Local Feature Sampling (LLFS) module. Specifically, the PLB module designs two group feature transformers with distinct weights to extract global and local features at the group level, respectively. The LLFS module leverages inter-member 2D layout to generate spatial density relationships and performs targeted sampling on local features with the highest density, mitigating the impact of occlusion with layout variations. Experimental evaluations conducted on three public available datasets, including RoadGroup, CSG, and SYSUGroup, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.
